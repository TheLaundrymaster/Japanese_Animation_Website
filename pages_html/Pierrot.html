<p style="text-indent: 50px">
    Pierrot Co., Ltd. (株式会社ぴえろ,
    Kabushiki-gaisha Piero) is a Japanese animation studio
    established in May 1979 by former employees of Tatsunoko
    Production and Mushi Production. Its headquarters are
    located in Mitaka, Tokyo. Pierrot is renowned for several
    worldwide popular anime series,
    such as <i>Naruto, Bleach, Yu Yu Hakusho, Black Clover,
    Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Tokyo Ghoul, </i>and <i>Great
    Teacher Onizuka</i>. <br/><br/>
<div style="text-indent: 50px;font-size: 25px;line-height: 2">
    The company has a logo of the face of a clown.
    "Piero" is a Japanese loanword for clown, adopted
    from the classical character of Pierrot.
    <i>Yu Yu Hakusho</i> and <i>Saiyuki</i>, two of the company's
    anime series, won the Animage Anime Grand Prix
    Award in 1994 and 1995, and 2000, respectively.</div>

<summary class="underline"><i>Ryne's Take:</i></summary>
<p style="text-indent: 50px">
    Personally, if someone were to ask me what Pierrot
    shows have I seen I would have no answer...yet all of my
    favorite childhood manga have been adapted by them. Along
    with the works of Toei Animation, Pierrot is the other half
    of my childhood. Shows like Naruto and Bleach were staples
    in my early manga reading days. Pierrot Animation along with
    Toei Animation I have notice the immense change of the shows
    that may have started to been animated in the 80s to 90s to
    more modern and fluid looking now in the 21st century.
<div style="text-indent: 50px;font-size: 25px;line-height: 2">
    It is pretty amazing that a studio can make these shows
    and I can have memories of them but not know the studio's
    name. In a way it shows to me how dedicated they are to the
    craft and not care too much of the publicity. They just
    make solid animations that everyone can enjoy. And with their latest
show <i>Black Clover</i> the legacy continues of amazing shows.</div>

<p><div id="nar"> Prior to Naruto Uzumaki's birth, a huge demon known as the Kyuubi, the Nine-Tailed Fox, attacked Konohagakure, the Hidden Leaf Village, and wreaked havoc. In order to put an end to the Kyuubi's rampage, the leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage, sacrificed his life and sealed the monstrous beast inside the newborn Naruto.

    Now, Naruto is a hyperactive and knuckle-headed ninja still living in Konohagakure. Shunned because of the Kyuubi inside him, Naruto struggles to find his place in the village, while his burning desire to become the Hokage of Konohagakure leads him not only to some great new friends, but also some deadly foes.

    Synopsis

<p><div id="ble"></div></p>-->
        <p><div id="ble">Ichigo Kurosaki is an ordinary high schooler—until his family is attacked by a Hollow, a corrupt spirit that seeks to devour human souls. It is then that he meets a Soul Reaper named Rukia Kuchiki, who gets injured while protecting Ichigo's family from the assailant. To save his family, Ichigo accepts Rukia's offer of taking her powers and becomes a Soul Reaper as a result.

    However, as Rukia is unable to regain her powers, Ichigo is given the daunting task of hunting down the Hollows that plague their town. However, he is not alone in his fight, as he is later joined by his friends—classmates Orihime Inoue, Yasutora Sado, and Uryuu Ishida—who each have their own unique abilities. As Ichigo and his comrades get used to their new duties and support each other on and off the battlefield, the young Soul Reaper soon learns that the Hollows are not the only real threat to the human world.
