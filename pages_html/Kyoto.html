<p style="text-indent: 50px">
    Kyoto Animation was co-founded in 1981 by married couple Yoko and Hideaki Hatta;
    it became a limited company in 1985 and a corporation in 1999.
    Yoko Hatta, who serves as the company's vice president, had worked as a painter
    at Mushi Production until she moved to Kyoto after marrying her husband, who serves as president.
    The company's logo originates from the kanji kyō (京), the first character of Kyoto (京都).

    Since 2009, Kyoto Animation has hosted the annual Kyoto Animation
    Awards in three categories: original novels, manga, and scenarios.
    Some winning submissions are published under the company's KA Esuma Bunko imprint,
    and have a chance of being later adapted as anime.<i>
    Love, Chunibyo & Other Delusions, Free!, Beyond the Boundary and
    Myriad Colors Phantom World</i> were based on novels that received an honorable mention in this competition.
    In 2014, the novel <i>Violet Evergarden</i>
    became the first and only work so far to win a grand prize in any of the
    three categories.</div>

<summary class="underline"><i>Ryne's Take:</i></summary>
<p style="text-indent: 50px">
    Kyoto Animation is an amazing studio. I have seen a number of their works. They are one of the studios that any fan would have seen atleast one show from them. They like to fuse action with incredible
    dramas that pull in the view's heartstrings. They make
    shows that seem light hearted by being comedic and having light action bits but
    then make you pull out the tissues at the end. This is from
    the amazing source material they use to animate. The majority of shows they have animated
    are adapted form manga or light novels. The style
    of animation shows fluid movements in actions and helps slow
    things down for the drama.
