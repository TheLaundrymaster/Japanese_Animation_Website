<summary class="underline"><i>Brief History:</i></summary>

<p style="text-indent: 50px">
    Studio Trigger was founded by former Gainax employee Hiroyuki Imaishi, following his success with <i>Gurren
    Lagann</i> (2007). This led to the creation of Studio Trigger, with <i>Gurren Lagann's</i> visual humor and style defining the studio's work,
    and Trigger being seen as a successor to Gainax.
<div style="text-indent: 50px;font-size: 25px;line-height: 2">
    Studio Trigger was established on August 22, 2011 by Hiroyuki Imaishi and Masahiko
    ÅŒtsuka shortly after leaving Gainax. The studio name and official website was revealed in October 2011. Along with assisting production on various series,
    Trigger has released a short film, Little Witch Academia,and has developed its first original anime television series,
    <i>Kill la Kill</i>, which aired from October 2013 to March 2014. On July 8, 2013, Trigger launched a Kickstarter project in order to fund a second episode of
    <i>Little Witch Academia</i>.
    The project was well received and achieved its goal of $150,000
    in under five hours, and went on to raise a total of $625,518.</div>

<summary class="underline"><i>Ryne's Take:</i></summary>
<p style="text-indent: 50px">
    Studio Trigger is the studio that made me a fan boy of anime.
    Even though it was a little bit after I started to watch anime,
    Trigger influenced me greatly.
    I saw <i>Gurren Laggan</i> (which is technically a Gainax show) and it pushed
    me to follow the producers and creators and aim to watch almost
    everything they made. What I really enjoy of Studio Trigger's work is how
    they love to reference their own works in some way. Within the show, <i>Space Patrol Luluco</i>
    Trigger references <i>Inferno Cop</i> another older work of the creators.
    It is neat to try to find all the easter eggs.
