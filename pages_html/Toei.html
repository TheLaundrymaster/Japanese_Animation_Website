<p style="text-indent: 50px">
    The studio was founded by animators Kenzō Masaoka and Zenjirō Yamamoto in 1948 as Japan Animated Films (日本動画映画, Nihon Dōga Eiga, often shortened to 日動映画 (Nichidō Eiga)).
    In 1956, Toei purchased the studio and it was renamed
    Toei Doga Co., Ltd. (東映動画株式会社, Tōei Dōga Kabushiki-gaisha,
    "dōga" is Japanese for "animation"), doing business as Toei Animation Co.,
    Ltd. outside Japan. In 1998, the Japanese name was renamed to Toei
    Animation. It has created a number of TV series and movies and adapted
    Japanese comics as animated series, many popular worldwide. Hayao Miyazaki,
    Isao Takahata, Yasuji Mori, Leiji Matsumoto and Yoichi Kotabe have
    worked with the company. Toei is a shareholder in the Japanese
    anime satellite television network Animax with other anime studios
    and production companies, such as Sunrise, TMS Entertainment and Nihon
    Ad Systems Inc. The company is headquartered in the Ohizumi
    Studio in Nerima, Tokyo.<br/><br/>

    Toei Animation produced anime versions of works from
    manga series by manga artists, including Go Nagai
    (<i>Mazinger Z</i>), Eiichiro Oda (<i>One Piece</i>), Shotaro Ishinomori
    (<i>Cyborg 009</i>), Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro (<i>Toriko</i>), Takehiko Inoue
    (<i>Slam Dunk</i>), Mitsuteru Yokoyama (<i>Sally the Witch</i>), Masami Kurumada
    (<i>Saint Seiya</i>), Akira Toriyama (<i>Dragon Ball</i> and <i>Dr. Slump</i>), Leiji Matsumoto
    (<i>Galaxy Express 999</i>), and Naoko Takeuchi (<i>Sailor Moon</i>).
    The studio helped propel the popularity of the Magical Girl
    and Super Robot genres of anime; Toei's TV series include the
    first magical-girl anime series, <i>Mahoutsukai Sally</i> (an adaptation
    of Mitsuteru Yokoyama's manga of the same name), and Go Nagai's <i>Mazinger Z</i>
    , an adaptation of his manga which set the standard for Super Robot anime
    . Although the Toei Company usually allows Toei Animation to handle its
    animation, they occasionally hire other companies to provide animation;
    although the Toei Company produced the Robot Romance Trilogy, Sunrise
    (then known as Nippon Sunrise) provided the animation. Toei Company
    would also enlist the help of other studios such as hiring Academy
    Productions to produce the animation for Space Emperor God Sigma,
    rather then use their own studio.</div>

<summary class="underline"><i>Ryne's Take:</i></summary>
<p style="text-indent: 50px">
    Toei animation is the true legacy animation studio. It is the oldest one
    that is on the site. They have animated anime that are known
    as true classics in the anime world (<i>Sailor Moon</i> and <i>Dragon Ball</i> as examples). Without these visualizations of these critically aclaimed manga (original japanese comic book)
    the more modern age of anime would not be so great as
    it is. What is pretty cool is that they are recently
    remastering their old productions which is bringing
    a new generation to the amazing works of the past.
<div style="text-indent: 50px;font-size: 25px;line-height: 2">
    As I grew up, the shows I would catch on tv were
    Toei animation works as most of their shows were
    on Nickelodeon or Cartoon Network. At that age I
    never saw them as anime but just really cool cartoons.
    During that time I read manga more than watching anime. I
    felt that what pulled me into it all years later was the fact
    that the books I read were either shows already made or were coming
    out. Toei Animation and the manga they adapted from had a close
    connection to me during those days and even today years later.</div>
