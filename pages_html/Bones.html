<p>
<div style="text-indent: 50px;font-size: 25px;line-height: 2">
    Bones was founded by Sunrise staff members Masahiko Minami,
    Hiroshi Ōsaka and Toshihiro Kawamoto in October 1998.
    One of their first projects was collaborating with Sunrise
    on <i>Cowboy Bebop: Knockin' on Heaven's Door</i>, a feature film
    based on the <i>Cowboy Bebop</i> anime series.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 50px;font-size: 25px;line-height: 2">
    In 2007, the studio suffered the loss of co-founder
    Hiroshi Ōsaka, well known for his works as character
    designer on series such as <i>Mobile Suit Victory Gundam</i>,
    <i>Mobile Fighter G Gundam</i> and The Mars Daybreak.
    Ōsaka had been battling with cancer, and died from
    the disease on September 24, 2007. He was 44 years old.</div>
<div style="text-indent: 50px;font-size: 25px;line-height: 2">
    Since the death of Ōsaka, two new additions have been
    made to the studio's board of directors: Makoto Watanabe
    and Takahiro Komori. Komori is well known as a character
    designer and animator who has been with the studio since its
    inception. His previous works as designer consist of <i>Angelic Layer</i>,
    <i>Scrapped Princess</i>, and <i>Darker than Black</i>.</div>

<summary class="underline"><i>Ryne's Take:</i></summary>
<p style="text-indent: 50px">
    Bones is a more modern studio.
    Their works are kinda a hybrid,
    of adapting manga/light novels
    and original productions.
    They were the main studio
    that helped being the classic
    manga of <i>Fullmetal Alchemist</i>
    to life. For me this was the first
    work that I saw from the studio. While
    looking at all the works they have made
    and continue to make I am amazed at the
    hits they have had. More recently Studio
    Bones are the ones adapting the wildly successful
    Shojen Jump manga <i>My Hero Academia</i> which is soon
    getting its 5th season in 2021. Studio
    Bones is definitely
    one of the newer front
    runners in the modern animation.
